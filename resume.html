                I've been acting for three decades now, which might be described as "a proven track record" or "delivering consistent results" on LinkedIn. I'm currently on a sabbatical to spend time with family and attempt being a 9-to-5 professional.<br><br>
                In recent years, I've built what The Wall Street Journal recently called "a business empire." Still trying to figure out what they meant by that.

                My skills include writing, re-writing, tweeting, mixing cocktails, backend engineering for software platforms and watching lower-tier Welsh football matches. Proficiency ranges from excellent to absolutely awful.
